Led by Clark, the sheriff's posse joined in the violence, riding into a sea of demonstrators as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and attacking them with clubs and tear gas. In 1955, after the death of the Dallas County sheriff, Clark was appointed by his friend Gov. James E. Folsom to fill the post and later was later elected to two more terms. The next year, Clark was defeated when he ran for re-election. But it was Bloody Sunday that cemented Clark's reputation. ""What they want,"" Clark told The Times in 1965, speaking of civil rights demonstrators, ""is black supremacy."" Two years later, during a voting rights demonstration by black youth, Clark led the group, with the aid of cattle prods, on a forced march, making the protesters run faster and faster. As sheriff, Clark soon became known for his regular intimidation of black would-be voters. Clark was divorced from his wife, Louise. On Clark's authority, protesters were routinely beaten and tear- gassed and on one occasion were led on forced marches. By the mid-1960s, Clark was considered one of the most controversial men in Alabama, if not the South. A replica of Clark's ""Never"" button is on display at the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute in Selma, along with one of the batons used on Bloody Sunday. Enshrined in the public memory for acts of brutality, Clark could be charming and even courtly in private, according to many news accounts of the period. In another incident, widely televised, Clark punched the civil rights leader C.T. Vivian so hard he broke his own hand. Jim Clark, the former sheriff in Selma, Ala., whose violent, highly public attempts to maintain the status quo there in the Jim Crow era are widely believed to have contributed, however inadvertently, to the success of the voting rights movement, died Monday in Elba, Ala. Clark was famous in particular for the events of March 7, 1965 -- known ever after as Bloody Sunday -- when peaceful black protesters in Selma, on their way to Montgomery, were beaten back by Alabama state troopers under the direction of Gov. George C. Wallace. From 1955 to 1966, Clark was the sheriff of Dallas County, Ala., which includes Selma."

""I've always viewed that Bertarelli's money is as good as anyone else's,"" Dalton said at the time. Both men will sail in the competition, but while Dickson steers his boat, Dalton will often take on the role of a sewerman and pack and unpack sails in the shadows below deck. Within weeks, Dalton, one of the world's most successful around- the-world racers, agreed to take charge of New Zealand's next syndicate, and one of the first personnel moves he made was to tell Barker that, despite all the water under the bridge and on the deck, he wanted him to return as the helmsman. But the America's Cup remained unfamiliar territory for Dalton, whose biggest quibble with Valencia is the dust that can blow through the port and into eyes and equipment. Four intense years of fundraising and match racing later, Dalton and Barker are ready Monday to start their national rehabilitation project in earnest. But Dalton, a straight- talking sailor untainted by the defeat, turned out to be the right messenger, even if he came under some scrutiny from other potential syndicates when he accepted a multimillion-dollar, interest-free loan from Ernesto Bertarelli, the head of Alinghi and the man who had snatched Coutts and his lieutenants away. ""Their confidence was knocked terribly,"" Dalton said.  That is still less than half of what he estimates BMW Oracle Racing is spending.  THE BRIDGE VALENCIA, Spain Grant Dalton was on the shore and Dalton says his team now has a satisfactory budget. ""It couldn't end that way,"" Dalton said. in 2003, a Kiwi can never be too certain that his team and equipment can handle the pressures. Dalton has also pushed the envelope in training: intentionally blowing out several spinnakers to learn the limits of his two boats' design. Dalton negotiated a lead sponsorship with Fly Emirates, the airline based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2004, but he has also negotiated dozens of minor sponsorships with New Zealand companies and some restaurants. But Dalton eventually repaid the loan on his own. ""As a Kiwi, not just a yachtsman, it was really hard to watch,"" Dalton said. The majority of the racing team at BMW Oracle are New Zealanders, and like Dalton's team, they also trained and boat tested in Auckland during the Northern Hemisphere winter. What got Dalton to this point was offshore racing and an acumen for crunching budgets: no surprise considering that he once worked as an accountant before sailing began to pay his bills. Dalton knew Blake well and, like Blake, who was murdered by bandits on his boat in Brazil in 2001, Dalton is trying to make the transition from sailing between continents to sailing around buoys."

1	Takashi Murakami	Takashi Murakami	"Like Murakami's paintings of mushroom-cloud skulls, these renditions of Eve and Adam have been interpreted as comments on a collective Japanese psyche traumatized and infantilized by World War II, the dropping of the atom bombs and the lengthy American occupation. Raised by parents who drummed Western art into him, Murakami studied traditional nihonga painting, and attempted a career in animation, before deciding to become a contemporary artist. It defines Murakami, now 46, as a late-blooming talent with a steep learning curve. But actually it's an ingenious key to the Pandora's box of Murakami's art and stuffed with questions of art and commerce, high and low, public brand and private expression, mass production and exquisite craft. One leaves this show feeling that Murakami has found a new benign Pandora's box: the richness of traditional Japanese art. Most of Murakami's creatures recur in an array of toys, T-shirts, pins and decals fabricated at Kaikai Kiki. And, finally, in the last two galleries of the exhibition, Murakami's painting explodes with a new complexity of color and meaning, matching the intensity of the flower room, but without the mind-blanking repetition. But there it is, at the Brooklyn Museum, bright and gleaming and blending seamlessly with its setting: a sleek, stylish and sometimes silly survey of the work of Takashi Murakami. Murakami siphons motifs from Disney and Dal?, strategies from Pop Art, and sexual fantasies from Japan's anime (animation) and manga (comics) subcultures. The ensemble fulfills almost too completely Murakami's stated desire to make art ""that makes your mind go blank, that leaves you gaping."" Even more spellbinding is a new animation dreamed up by Murakami and his Kaikai Kiki cohort (the credits take several minutes). After all, Murakami oversees a company, Kaikai Kiki (kaikaikikimeans something both elegant and bizarre), that produces his art and its spinoffs."

Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson said in Taipei Wednesday that the people of Taiwan deserve the same level of public health as anyone else in the world. Thompson said in the 2002 speech that the U.S. ""one China"" policy should not hinder Taiwan's efforts to access the world's health information, nor should it become a barrier for Taiwan joining the World Health Organization or other international health programs. Thompson, who served as U.S. secretary of health and human services from 2001-2005, made the remarks after receiving a decoration from President Chen Shui-bian in a ceremony held at the Presidential Office.

1	Robert Wilson	Robert Wilson (director)	After returning New York, Wilson did therapeutic work with hyperactive and autistic children and terminally ill catatonic patients and eventually adopted a deaf-mute black street kid whom he later cast in ``Deafman Glance,'' one of his most successful pieces. Deftly and painstakingly presented to convey the sense of a remarkably cohesive whole, Wilson's work is placed in the context of a life that seems at once familiar and extraordinary. In her film, Otto-Bernstein sheds light on the themes that have threaded through Wilson's life with a remarkable consistency, force and directness; the interest in nonverbal communication, the nurturing of talent and the faith in the therapeutic properties of art particularly among those dismissed as lost causes. A couple years ago, I eagerly went to see Robert Wilson's ``The Black Rider,'' a dark fairy tale made in collaboration with Tom Waits and William S. Burroughs, and fell asleep halfway through the performance. Arguably the pre-eminent avant-garde theater artist, the amazingly prolific Wilson is known for his surrealistic visual style and his deconstructive approach to language, as well as for the deliberate slowness and length of his productions. Born in Waco, Texas, to a strict Southern Baptist family, Wilson suffered from a speech impediment and learning disabilities as a child. Impressive as is Wilson's output and oeuvre, it's the fully engaged, aesthetically driven life that fascinates.

1	Ryan Howard	Ryan Howard	"So, if Bonds never tested positive for steroids, Howard said it would be good for baseball if Bonds became the career home run champion. Howard could be loosely connected to Bonds this season if pitchers give him the so-called Bonds treatment. ""I just wanted to see how good I am naturally with what I've been given,"" Howard said. ""I believe in his speech he said the game needs someone like me,"" Howard said. Still, Howard, 27, was cautious while discussing Bonds and Mark McGwire, the former slugger for the Oakland Athletics and the St. Louis Cardinals who received a flimsy 23.5 percent of the vote in January in his first year of eligibility for the Hall of Fame. As the Phillies challenged for the wild card last September, Howard was given a taste of what Bonds has endured for several seasons. With Bonds and Sosa suspected of having used steroids, their sessions with reporters will probably unfold differently than Howard's half-hour interview did here Sunday. Howard's first comments of the spring will probably also make millions of parents want to hug him, as he said that he ""never really saw the purpose"" of using steroids and that using them was ""not who I am out there.""  WITH PRIDE, HOWARD SAYS MVP ABILITY IS ALL NATURAL When Howard was asked if it would be good for baseball if Bonds eclipsed Aaron's record, he said, ""Why not? But, Howard said, knowing players who were using steroids and who produced statistics inferior to his validated his choice. When Howard was asked how he would have voted on McGwire, he said: ""If I had a vote? While Howard said they only spoke briefly, Aaron seemed to be sending a message to Howard and many others during the presentation. ""Everybody is going to look at it in a different way,"" Howard said. ""I'd probably be asleep,"" Howard said. ""I've never had anybody come up to me and offer me steroids,"" Howard said. That player is Ryan Howard, the hulking, smiling first baseman of the Philadelphia Phillies. ""I'm the kind of guy that I'm simple,"" Howard said. That was not enough evidence to convince Howard that Bonds, who reportedly tested positive for amphetamines last year, had done anything wrong. ""I just never saw the benefit of doing it,"" said Howard, who batted .313 How would Howard feel?"

Springer became something of a poor man's hero last fall when he signed on as one of the ``stars'' of ABC's competition series ``Dancing With the Stars.'' Springer's hand in catapulting ``Dancing'' to its biggest audience ever -- nearly 21 million viewers for the performance broadcasts and close to 20 million on results nights -- has to have galled NBC a bit, given that he does his talk show over at NBC Universal. When Springer finally did get the hook, he thanked the audience for having him, ``and thank you for letting me go home.'' Former House majority leader Tom DeLay urged viewers to vote for that nice brimming-with-American-values country singer contestant Sara Evans, warning that otherwise ``ultra liberal talk show host'' Springer was sure to win and the moral fiber of America would be sapped, or whatever it is that happens to moral fiber when ``smut'' like Jerry Springer wins TV dancing competitions. Possessing two left feet, Springer mostly played the clown during performances and was often left gasping for breath. Springer had outlasted not only Evans but also Harry Hamlin and Vivica Fox. Jerry Springer, longtime host of one of TV's skankier talk shows, is replacing America's all-around nice guy Regis Philbin as host of ``America's Got Talent'' when the NBC competition series returns this summer for a second season.

""If ""We need to let Salisbury know what they did to these kids at the 11th hour was wrong.""

""That was my big dream, my future, right there,"" not apply to other schools. ""That was my big dream, my future, right there,"" said Yet even when Adamson learned that the youths were unlikely to meet Salisbury's admissions standards, he failed to clearly convey the news, according to Berment, Goss, their parents and advocates. Because Adamson led the youths to believe Salisbury would admit them, Berment and Goss did not apply to other schools. Goss was confident enough about a future at Salisbury that he bade farewell in June to his teachers and friends at Madison Park. Salisbury was the first prep school in recent years to formally recruit players in the Dorchester program, and the prospect of Berment and Goss chasing their dreams was hailed by parents, coaches, and community leaders as inspiration for other at-risk youths. With Adamson failing to deliver, Cousin suggested that he betrayed Salisbury's motto - ""Esse Quam Videri,"" Latin for ""To be, rather than to seem"" - and should be accountable if trouble were to befall Berment or Goss.

While the Badger defense kept the other Wildcats in check, Hughes scored a career high-tying 25 points inside and outside as Wisconsin pulled away in the second half to win, 72-55. Beasley took almost half of the Wildcats first-half shots (13 out of 27) and scored more than half the points (17 of 33). Wisconsin, which led the nation in scoring defense, opened a 10-point first half lead by making sure no other Wildcats besides Beasley contributed to the offense.

Another time, Rivera said, he put $20,000 of drug money in a duffel bag at Graham's instruction and waited outside his Atlanta hotel for Kai Franklin. Authorities have filed no charges against Franklin, nor have they presented all the evidence that might incriminate her. Franklin and Graham remained in regular contact, even after he skipped bond and she filed for divorce, citing abandonment, according to testimony at his sentencing hearing. Moore told a judge that Franklin ""may have very critical information"" about Graham's connections to the killings of another defendant and that man's girlfriend in Atlanta three years ago. Kai Franklin made no mention of payments from her father's company when she filed for bankruptcy in March 2005. Moore, the prosecutor, asked Wright, the IRS agent: ""Would it be hard for [Franklin] to deny that perhaps she was aware that the source of the money was drug dealing when, at that point, her husband was indicted for drug dealing and was a fugitive from law enforcement?"" Eric Rivera, who received a 40-month sentence, testified that Graham told him to take $25,000 in cash to his house, where Franklin was then living alone. Kai Franklin, 34, handled tens of thousands of dollars from cocaine sales in 2004 and 2005, according to court records and testimony last month in South Carolina. Franklin used money from Graham to make payments on two Porsche sports utility vehicles while he was a fugitive, witnesses said. Graham allegedly funneled more money to Franklin through her father's airport concessions business. King, who has been sentenced to 24 years in prison, said he expected to regularly receive checks from Franklin and Wilson, giving the impression that he had legitimate income. Prosecutors alleged that Graham lied when he told federal agents that Franklin was not involved in his drug business - partly to protect her, but also to minimize his own culpability. Scott King, who was Graham's partner in the drug business, testified that Graham invested $150,000 of their money in David Franklin's Atlanta-based company, Franklin and Wilson Airport Concessions Inc. < In addition, another defendant said, Franklin received portions of $150,000 in drug money invested in an airport concessions company run by her father, the mayor's former husband. Franklin twice received bags of drug money - one containing $25,000, the other $20,000 - at the direction of her former husband, Tremayne Graham, one of his co-defendants testified. Authorities also allege that the money Graham sent Franklin came from his drug business, and that she had to have known that. King said Franklin routinely sent bills to Graham while he was a fugitive. And Mark Moore, an assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Graham, gave a judge a broad outline of Franklin's possible involvement: < David Franklin said Tuesday the investment ""never happened. But the sentencing transcript and other court documents reveal the extent to which Franklin is implicated in the drug case. In court last month, one of Graham's lawyers said some of the money Graham sent Kai Franklin came from gambling winnings. Franklin divorced Graham in 2005. Prosecutors did not establish in court when the alleged payments were made or how much of the $150,000 ended up with Kai Franklin.

Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark on Monday called Egypt's decision to try 40 members of the country's most powerful opposition group before a military tribunal ""pitiful"" and demanded their case be tried in an open courtroom.

Why is it ashamed of doing it can't do it in broad daylight as the law requires?"" said Clark, who was attorney general under U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson despite opposing the Vietnam War. Besides Saddam, Clark has worked with blind Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, a planner of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and American Indian activist Leonard Peltier, convicted in a 1975 gunfight at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in which two FBI agents died. Clark, along with human rights activists and the defendants' family members, were not allowed inside the military court for a hearing on Sunday.

Brown dismissed Clarke's claim at a final news conference of the year, telling reporters on Wednesday that he made no apologies for attempting to get inactive Britons into work. Clarke said Brown had asked newly appointed ministers drawn from outside traditional politics -- such as former U.N.

The hostility, in the eyes of the mudslingers, is because Olson reneged on his word that he would return to Provo, Utah, after completing a two-year Mormon mission. Olson already found out how strong the feelings are about his departure when UCLA opened the 2006 season at home against Utah, the fierce rival of BYU. ""When it got down to it,"" Olson said, ""I just wanted to play against the Pac-10."" we'd love to have him here, but I don't blame him. ""I think the fans look at it Kehl, who left on his mission a few months after Olson, said he was surprised when Olson decided not to return to BYU, but does not take it personally. Olson's former roommate and still-close friend, senior linebacker Bryan Kehl, stoked those emotions after the Cougars' 20-7 defeat of Arizona last week. Olson, now UCLA's quarterback, is coming off a 286-yard five-touchdown performance last week at Stanford. That is, if Olson, now a junior, is back for his senior season. The Cougars were trailing 34-7 at the half, and Olson was told to warm up because he was going in the game. I've ever been around, and we'd love to have him here, but I don't blame him. ""I BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall, who replaced Crowton after the 2004 season, never spoke with Olson about a return. The greeting coming from the northwest corner of the Rose Bowl toward Olson figures to be nasty, but nothing like what could transpire Sept. 13, 2008, when UCLA travels to Provo to take on BYU. Nixon said. ""I don't blame him one bit. He's a great quarterback. He's one of the best his decision,"" Nixon said. ""I don't blame him one bit. He's a great quarterback. He's one According to people close to Olson, a series of events began to transpire almost immediately upon his arrival in which he thought he was misled.

Clarke, who died Wednesday aged 90, captured the world's imagination with his vision of the future in books such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and predicted communication satellites.

Asked where he would be if he didn't cross paths with Andre Craig and Mattie Baker, Carter said: ""I might be in jail.

On Thursday, the same day Carter shot-faked pressure and hit the game-winner against Houston, Brummel reminisced about Carter's journey -- beginning at a crammed home in a rough neighborhood, then to high school, where he dropped out, and then to the streets, where he landed. Carter thrived at Saddleback. His uncles would go through the turnstile at Carter's crowded home -- back from jail, off to jail. And, after his freshman season, Carter dropped out of high school, never to return. Soon, Carter sent Brummel some grainy video footage of some midnight games.

Craig asked Carter if he ever considered playing junior college basketball. To them, Carter was the superstar, the hero. For 16-year-old Richie Torres, who had looked at school as the enemy, Carter's speech was something of a revival.  He told the impressionable students about his elementary school dream, and how he is does today in the Nuggets' backcourt. ""He was a superstar,"" Haden said. Pushed After playing for three other NBA teams, Carter came to Denver last season, signed during the summer for this season. Craig had floated into Carter's life like an angel, and Carter, essentially, swatted the angel away. Carter the boy was the exact opposite of Carter the guard. On NBA draft night, Carter and Haden watched together, torturing themselves. Carter dismissed the idea, the promise, of school.

""There's a problem in Paris, Texas,"" she said. The case has raised racial tensions in Paris, a town of 26,000 with a history of fraught relations between blacks and whites. ""It is a racist town, and Paris has always been a racist town."" To some, it sounded like the Byrd case, in which a black man in the East Texas town of Jasper, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of Paris, was chained by the ankles to the back of a pickup by three white supremacists and dragged for three miles."

Wilson IV, criticizing the Bush administration. After complaints that Bush loyalists had leaked Wilson's name to punish her husband for his criticism, a special prosecutor was named to investigate how her identity had been disclosed. The prosecutor, Patrick J.

Harry Reid of Nevada, said Wednesday that ""Olson will not be confirmed"" and vowed ""to do everything I can to prevent him from being confirmed as the next attorney general."" Senators and aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Olson is considered a top candidate for the Justice Department job. A spokesman for Reid said the Democratic leader was concerned that Olson was too partisan to take over the Justice Department, which has been bruised by allegations of political meddling in federal prosecutions. Olson was widowed Sept. 11, 2001, when his third wife, Barbara Olson, was on the hijacked American Airlines plane that flew into the Pentagon. For Olson, a big stumbling block could be his hearings six years ago, before his narrow 51-47 confirmation to be solicitor general.  DEMOCRATS WARN BUSH AGAINST TAPPING TED OLSON FOR ATTORNEY Hatch said he knew of at least 10 Senate Democrats who would vote against Olson, if Bush were to nominate him. Democratic senators sent a strong message to President Bush on Wednesday: Don't even think about nominating former Solicitor General Ted Olson to replace outgoing Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Although Olson represented the federal government in numerous arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court during his three years as solicitor general during Bush's first term, the 67-year-old lawyer earned a special notoriety for his role successfully representing Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney in the Supreme Court case that gave the 2000 election to the Republican ticket. Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who has been the driving force behind an investigation into Gonzales' decision to fire at least eight federal prosecutors last year, said Olson would be a divisive choice. Democratic aides have been researching the backgrounds of possible nominees, including Olson. Olson is ""certainly not a consensus nominee,"" Schumer said."
